```javascript
// ... your Tailwind CSS configuration
module.exports = {
  // ... other configurations
plugins: [require('tailwindcss'),
  // Add other plugins here
],
}
```
This configuration might lead to issues if you have other plugins that conflict with Tailwind CSS or if the `tailwindcss` plugin is not properly installed or configured.  Ensure you have followed the official Tailwind CSS installation instructions carefully.
